the objective of this programming project is to construct a cross-reference index for a given text
file. such index structures have applications in the design of compilers and databases.
our task is to write a program that while reading a text file collects all words of the text and retains
the numbers of the lines in which each word occurred. when this scan is terminated, a table is printed
showing all collected words in alphabetical order with lists of line numbers where they occurred. there
would be only one line for each word.
represent the words encountered in the text by a binary search tree (also called a lexicographic
tree). for example, if there were three words ‘abracadabra’, ‘hocuspocus’, and ‘watchamaycalli’,
‘hocuspocus’ would be the root with ‘abracadabra’ its left child and ‘watchamaycalli’ its right child. each
node not only contains a word as key ‘watchamaycalli22’,#
